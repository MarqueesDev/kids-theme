# 🌑 Kids Theme for VS Code

A **pitch-black theme**, designed to follow the **color standards of VS Code** itself — but made for those who find the official VS Code themes **too light**.  
It even includes **compatibility with `.cfg` files**, ensuring consistent visuals across custom configuration files.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 Deep, eye-comforting **pitch black** background
- 🧩 Fully aligned with **VS Code UI colors**
- 🗂️ Enhanced support for `.cfg` files
- 💻 Ideal for long coding sessions or low-light environments
- ⚙️ Super easy installation with automated updates: the theme automatically applies the settings in `settings.json` for a ready-to-use experience
- 📦 Already comes with the ***`Material Icon Theme`*** activated for a modern and organized view of files
