# 🌑 Pitch Black Theme for VS Code

A **pitch-black theme**, designed to follow the **color standards of VS Code** itself — but made for those who find the official VS Code themes **too light**.  
It even includes **compatibility with `.cfg` files**, ensuring consistent visuals across custom configuration files.
